# Historical NBA Service

### Summary

This service provides a proxy on top of RapidAPI's Free NBA API and also adds an option to save custom comments for the
games.

The comments are saved in an in-memory database, which makes it easy to run, but it also means that the data will be
lost after restarting the application.

You can learn about the API endpoints after running the application at /swagger-ui
